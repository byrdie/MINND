	abstract = "Signatures of explosive events are prominent in transition region spectra where they display exceptionally large velocities (&gt;100 km s−1) in small areas (1500 km). Their physical properties, deduced from previous analyses of \{HRTS\} spectra and more recent work, are summarized here. It now appears that the explosive events are associated with the process of magnetic cancellation and \{HRTS\} data obtained during the most recent rocket flight in 1990 provide direct evidence for this assertion. Flux cancellation, which tends to proceed on time-scales of hours, most likely involves magnetic reconnection in a very bursty manner which explains the small, short-lived explosive events. These reconnection events are part of a larger pattern where small flux elements emerge in the supergranule centers and are transported to the boundaries to continually regenerate the network fields on a timescale of about 8 hours. These timescales are also sufficiently short to account for the energetics of the quiet sun. "

	abstract="Temporary enhancements of the coronal emission measure in a quiet region have been shown to constitute a significant energy input. Here some relatively large events are studied for simultaneous brightenings in transition region lines and in radio emission. Associated emissions are discussed and tested for characteristics known from full-sized impulsive flares in active regions. Heating events and flares are found to have many properties in common, including (i) associated polarized radio emission, which usually precedes the emission measure peak (Neupert effect) and sometimes has a non-thermal spectrum, and (ii) associated and often preceding peaks in O{\thinspace}v and He{\thinspace}i emission. On the other hand, heating events also differ from impulsive flares: (i) In half of the cases, their radio emission at centimeter waves shows a spectrum consistent with thermal radiation, (ii) the ratio of the gyro-synchrotron emission to the estimated thermal soft X-ray emission is smaller than in flares, and (iii) the associated emission in the O{\thinspace}v transition region line shows red shifts and blue shifts, indicating upflows in the rise phase and downflows in the decay phase, respectively. Nevertheless, the differences seem to be mainly quantitative, and the analyzed heating events with thermal energies around 1026 erg may in principle be considered as microflares or large nanoflares, thus small versions of regular flares.",

	abstract={The solar transition region is the site of supersonic plasma jets and sporadic radiative events, whose origin and physical nature have not been understood. Here we show that ubiquitous small-scale magnetic flux "tubes," constantly emerging from subsurface layers, may cause the formation of plasma jets and a sporadic excess of temperature near the solar surface. These flux tubes collide and reconnect, creating a sling-shot effect that generates complex three-dimensional shock waves with the curved surface. Self-focusing of these shocks occurs as they propagate upward in the rarefied atmosphere. Depending on the geometry of the shock collision, highly concentrated energy may be converted entirely into either heat or strong jets, or distributed between the two.}

Explanations for this enigma typically invoke the deposition in the corona of nonthermal energy generated by magnetoconvection. However, the coronal heating mechanism remains unknown. We used observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Hinode solar physics mission to reveal a ubiquitous coronal mass supply in which chromospheric plasma in fountainlike jets or spicules is accelerated upward into the corona, with much of the plasma heated to temperatures between ~0.02 and 0.1 million kelvin (MK) and a small but sufficient fraction to temperatures above 1 MK. These observations provide constraints on the coronal heating mechanism(s) and highlight the importance of the interface region between photosphere and corona.},

	abstract={Our understanding of the process of fast reconnection has undergone a dramatic change in the last 10 years driven, in part, by the availability of high-resolution numerical simulations that have consistently demonstrated the break-up of current sheets into magnetic islands, with reconnection rates that become independent of Lundquist number, challenging the belief that fast magnetic reconnection in flares proceeds via the Petschek mechanism which invokes pairs of slow-mode shocks connected to a compact diffusion region. The reconnection sites are too small to be resolved with images, but these reconnection mechanisms, Petschek and the plasmoid instability, have reconnection sites with very different density and velocity structures and so can be distinguished by high-resolution line-profile observations. Using IRIS spectroscopic observations we obtain a survey of typical line profiles produced by small-scale events thought to be reconnection sites on the Sun. Slit-jaw images are used to investigate the plasma heating and re-configuration at the sites. A sample of 15 events from 2 active regions is presented. The line profiles are complex with bright cores and broad wings extending to over 300 km s −1 . The profiles can be reproduced with the multiple magnetic islands and acceleration sites that characterize the plasmoid instability but not by bi-directional jets that characterize the Petschek mechanism. This result suggests that if these small-scale events are reconnection sites, then fast reconnection proceeds via the plasmoid instability, rather than the Petschek mechanism during small-scale reconnection on the Sun.}

	abstract={We present a study of a typical explosive event (EE) at subarcsecond scale witnessed by strong non-Gaussian profiles with blue- and redshifted emission of up to 150 km s –1 seen in the transition region Si IV 1402.8 Å, and the chromospheric Mg II k 2796.4 Å and C II 1334.5 Å observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph ( IRIS ) at unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution. For the first time an EE is found to be associated with very small-scale (~120 km wide) plasma ejection followed by retraction in the chromosphere. These small-scale jets originate from a compact bright-point-like structure of ~1.''5 size as seen in the IRIS 1330 Å images. SDO /AIA and SDO /HMI co-observations show that the EE lies in the footpoint of a complex loop-like brightening system. The EE is detected in the higher temperature channels of AIA 171 Å, 193 Å, and 131 Å, suggesting that it reaches a higher temperature oflog T = 5.36 ± 0.06 (K). Brightenings observed in the AIA channels with durations 90-120 s are probably caused by the plasma ejections seen in the chromosphere. The wings of the C II line behave in a similar manner to the Si IV'S , indicating close formation temperatures, while the Mg II k wings show additional Doppler-shifted emission. Magnetic convergence or emergence followed by cancellation at a rate of 5 × 10 14 Mx s –1 is associated with the EE region. The combined changes of the locations and the flux of different magnetic patches suggest that magnetic reconnection must have taken place. Our results challenge several theories put forward in the past to explain non-Gaussian line profiles, i.e., EEs. Our case study on its own, however, cannot reject these theories; thus, further in-depth studies on the phenomena producing EEs are required.}

	abstract = "Abstract Properly designing an artificial neural network is very important for achieving the optimal performance. This study aims to utilize an architecture of these networks together with the Taylor polynomials, to achieve the approximate solution of second kind linear Volterra integral equations system. For this purpose, first we substitute the Nth truncation of the Taylor expansion for unknown functions in the origin system. Then we apply the suggested neural net for adjusting the numerical coefficients of given expansions in resulting system. Consequently, the reported architecture using a learning algorithm that based on the gradient descent method, will adjust the coefficients in given Taylor series. The proposed method was illustrated by several examples with computer simulations. Subsequently, performance comparisons with other developed methods was made. The comparative experimental results showed that this approach is more effective and robust. "

	Abstract = {The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) provides multiple simultaneous high-resolution full-disk images of the corona and transition region up to 0.5 R above the solar limb with 1.5-arcsec spatial resolution and 12-second temporal resolution. The AIA consists of four telescopes that employ normal-incidence, multilayer-coated optics to provide narrow-band imaging of seven extreme ultraviolet (EUV) band passes centered on specific lines: Fe xviii (94 Å), Fe viii, xxi (131 Å), Fe ix (171 Å), Fe xii, xxiv (193 Å), Fe xiv (211 Å), He ii (304 Å), and Fe xvi (335 Å). One telescope observes C iv (near 1600 Å) and the nearby continuum (1700 Å) and has a filter that observes in the visible to enable coalignment with images from other telescopes. The temperature diagnostics of the EUV emissions cover the range from 6×10 K to 2×10 K. The AIA was launched as a part of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission on 11 February 2010. AIA will advance our understanding of the mechanisms of solar v},

	Abstract = {Explosive events appear as broad non-Gaussian wings in the line profiles of small transition-region phenomena. Images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) give a first view of the plasma dynamics at the sites of explosive events seen simultaneously in O vi spectra of a region of quiet Sun, taken with the ultraviolet spectrometer Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). Distinct event bursts were seen either at the junction of supergranular network cells or near emerging flux. Three are described in the context of their surrounding transition region (304 Å) and coronal (171 Å) activity. One showed plasma ejections from an isolated pair of sites, with a time lag of 50 seconds between events. At the site where the later explosive event was seen, the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images show a hot core surrounded by a small, expanding ring of chromospheric emission, which we interpret as a 'splash.'
