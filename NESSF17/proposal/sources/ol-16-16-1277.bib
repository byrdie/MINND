abstract = {A technique for the simultaneous acquisition of spectral image information, which implies spectral and spatial intensity distributions of light sources, is described. With this technique projections of an intensity distribution of the source o(x, y, $\lambda$) onto the xy plane are detected simultaneously, and the original distribution is numerically reconstructed from them by using an algorithm of computed tomography. Five projections are obtained experimentally as shared images by means of an imaging system equipped with a transmission grating and detected by a monochromatic television camera. The spatial and spectral distributions of the objects are reconstructed with the multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique.},
