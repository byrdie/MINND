abstract = {The paper describes a new approach to studying the spectral-spatial characteristics of the objects, proposed by the authors, and the results of its experimental testing. This approach is based on application of tomographic principles to the spectral investigations of the objects. The results obtained show the great advantages of this method for the spectral analysis of spatially extended objects.},
