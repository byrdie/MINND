	\begin{abstract}
		The Multi-Order Solar EUV Spectrograph (MOSES) is a sounding rocket-based solar observatory designed to capture snapshot hyperspectral imagery of the solar transition region. Since hyperspectral images provide spectral information over a wide field-of-view, observations using MOSES allows for the determination of plasma flow over the entire structure of the loop. In this work, we present measurements of downflow velocities through two loop footpoints captured during the MOSES II flight in 2015 and compare these measurements to ballistic models of coronal rain.
