abstract = {The Multi-Order Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrograph (MOSES) is a high resolution, slitless imaging spectrometer that will observe the Sun in extreme ultraviolet near 304A. MOSES will fly on a NASA 
sounding rocket launch in spring 2004. The instrument records spatial and spectral information into images at three spectral orders. To recover the source spectrum, an ill-posed inversion must be performed 
on these data. We will explore two of the techniques by which this may be accomplished: Fourier backprojection and Pixons, constrained by the spatially integrated spectrum of the Sun. Both methods produce good results, including doppler shifts measured to 1/3-pixel accuracy. The Pixon code better reproduces the line widths.},
